<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


Amelia is a Discord Bot that helps our community.


Here's why:

* She provides fun community commands, making it even more fun for everyone!

Amelia has been in our community for over a year now, but her old code is deteriorating. That is why we, the staff team, decided to rewrite her from the ground up.
This makes Amelia not only better, but also future-proof, so that one day we may even be able to make her into a public bot.

### Built With
Amelia is built with love and
